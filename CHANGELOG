Pressing a dead key then a space should not output two characters. It should not output a space. It should output the dead key's terminator only. This is implemented, and prements overuse of the backspace key (when typing (".com")).

- disabled the dead key on the full stop/period key. There were no characters available through it. In essence, I could not find its use.

- implement the same deadkeys and output values except layed out according to the workman layout (for Mac OS Catalina only right now.)

# 2020-12-22 v1.51 Dvorak with Dvorak commands

Once again the dead keys are outputing a space when they should not be. This fixes it (by defining the spaceAction fully).
Pressing a dead key then a space should not output two characters. It should not output a space. It should output the dead key's regular output value only.
