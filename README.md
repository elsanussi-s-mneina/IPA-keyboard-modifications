These are modified versions of the IPA keyboard available from the SIL website at https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=uniipakeyboard (accessed at 2020 December 19th). 

They are modified to allow people accostumed to the Dvorak and Colemak keyboard layouts to be able to write in IPA.

I also made some changes in subsequent versions, see the change log.

Note: these changes are not official, and I have no relation, nor do I work for SIL at the time of writing.
